# 🧠 Git & GitHub Notes

## 📘 What is GitHub?

> GitHub is a **platform** built on top of Git that allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code projects using version control.

- It is **version control software** that tracks and manages code changes.  
- In GitHub, you can create **repositories** to store project-related files or source code.  
- All developers can connect to a repository to **integrate** and **manage code changes** easily.  
- GitHub automatically monitors all changes, including:
  - 👤 Who modified
  - 📅 When modified  
  - 🧩 What was modified  
  - 📝 Why modified

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

1. Create an account on [https://github.com](https://github.com)  
2. Download & install the **Git client software**  
3. Open Git Bash and configure your name and email:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "your-name"
   git config --global user.email "your-email"
   ```
💡 Note: Configuring name and email is a one-time process.

📂 What is a GitHub Repository?

A repository (repo) is a location where your project source code and files are stored.
Each project typically has its own repository.

🧱 Types of Repositories

1. Public Repository – Anyone can view it; you decide who can contribute.

2. Private Repository – Only authorized users can view and commit.

## Example:
- Project Git Repo URL: https://github.com/ashokitschool/dcb_loans_app.git
- Project team members connect to the repository using its URL.
